# Book App

Your homework for today is to practice! You're gonna create an app with one model `Book`.

- Walk back through today lesson. Create a new Rails app called `books-app`. Instead of `Artist` you'll create an `Author` model. 
- Come up with 4 fields that you want your author table to have (e.g.- publisher, genre, birthdate, first_name, last_name, pen_name)

- You'll need to add your own  data for the authors.

### The fields could be like this:

<table>
  <th colspan="2" style="text-align:center">Author</th>
  
  <tr>
    <td>first_name</td>
    <td>string</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>last_name</td>
    <td>string</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>number_of_books</td>
    <td>integer</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>author_birthdate</td>
    <td>datetime</td>
  </tr>
</table>



## Final result:
- User can see all the authors in `index.html.erb` file.
